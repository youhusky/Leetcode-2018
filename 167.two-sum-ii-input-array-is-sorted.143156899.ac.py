#
# Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find
# two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
# 
# The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they
# add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that
# your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
# 
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may
# not use the same element twice.
# 
# 
# Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
# Output: index1=1, index2=2
